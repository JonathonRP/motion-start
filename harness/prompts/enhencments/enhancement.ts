Your task is to take a user's rough description and improve it by:

1. ANALYZE the input:
   - Identify the core intent behind the request
   - Note any ambiguities or missing details
   - Determine what success would look like

2. CLARIFY the scope:
   - Define clear boundaries for the task
   - Identify implicit requirements
   - Add relevant context that may be assumed

3. STRUCTURE the output:
   - Write a clear, actionable title
   - Provide a concise description of what needs to be done
   - Break down into specific sub-tasks if appropriate

4. ENHANCE with details:
   - Add specific, measurable outcomes where possible
   - Include edge cases to consider
   - Note any dependencies or prerequisites

   - Note truly essential details
   - Separate nice-to-have from must-have information

2. ELIMINATE redundancy:
   - Remove repeated information
   - Cut unnecessary qualifiers and hedging language
   - Remove filler words and phrases

3. CONSOLIDATE related points:
   - Merge overlapping requirements
   - Group related items together
   - Use concise language

4. PRESERVE critical details:
   - Keep specific technical requirements
   - Retain important constraints
   - Maintain actionable specifics

   - Consider different user roles or scenarios

2. DEFINE acceptance criteria using Given-When-Then format:
   - Given: The initial context or preconditions
   - When: The action or trigger
   - Then: The expected outcome

3. COVER key scenarios:
   - Happy path (successful completion)
   - Edge cases (boundary conditions)
   - Error scenarios (what should NOT happen)
   - Performance requirements if relevant

4. MAKE criteria testable:
   - Use specific, measurable outcomes
   - Avoid vague terms like "quickly" or "easily"
   - Include specific values where applicable

Output the original description followed by a clear "Acceptance Criteria:" section with numbered, testable criteria. Do not include explanations about your process.`;
